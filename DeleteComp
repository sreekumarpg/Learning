Here is a PowerShell script that will check the DNSHostName and ObjectGUID from Get-ADComputer and delete the computer object if they match the input values:

powershell
Copy code
# Define the input values
$targetHostName = ""
$targetObjectGUID = ""

# Get the computer object that matches the DNSHostName and ObjectGUID
$computer = Get-ADComputer -Filter { Name -eq $targetHostName -and ObjectGUID -eq $targetObjectGUID }

# Check if the computer object was found
if ($computer) {
    Write-Host "Computer object found. Deleting the computer object..."
    # Delete the computer object
    Remove-ADComputer -Identity $computer.DistinguishedName -Confirm:$false
    Write-Host "Computer object deleted successfully."
} else {
    Write-Host "No computer object found with the specified DNSHostName and ObjectGUID."
}
